<h3 style="text-align:center;">By Kahlil Gibran</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">from <em>The Prophet</em></h3>
<div style= "width: 400px; font-style: italic; margin: 30px auto; background-color:#fafafa;">
  <blockquote>
Then a woman said, <br>
Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.<br><br>
And he answered:<br><br>
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.<br><br>
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.<br><br>
And how else can it be?<br><br>
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.<br><br>
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?<br><br>
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?<br><br>
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.<br><br>
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.<br><br>
Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.” <br><br>
But I say unto you,<br><br>
<span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;" >they are inseparable.</span><br><br>
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
<br><br>Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.<br><br>
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.<br><br>
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.
